# Face-Mask-Detection-using-YOLO
A Deep Learning approach implemented using Python programming language. Uses YOLO (You Look Only Once) model stacked on top of VGG19 (Transfer Learning) model. Takes a plain video clip as input and gives out the processed video clip as output.
A sample video is attached in this repository. Viewers can use this video to test the algorithm.
